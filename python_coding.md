# Python coding group

The Python coding group meets on Fridays from noon to 1 pm in the Coop Lab (M1-B406). All Fred Hutch and SCCA employees are welcome to attend!

Please see [this issue](https://github.com/FredHutch/community_groups/issues/5) to add ideas for these meetings.

The [fredpyapplication](https://github.com/FredHutch/fredpyapplication) repository is a collaborative, community-developed package of useful python functions being developed by the Python community at Fred Hutch.

## Developing Python packages

### Templates

- Fred Hutch maintains a template for [Python package development](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki-code-templates/tree/master/ToolDev-Python-Template). The README for that directory contains an explanation of all required and recommended files. Please see the [README](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki-code-templates) for the templates repository for usage instructions.
- The templates maintained by Fred Hutch represent core, essential components for software development. For projects that require more complexity, [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html) may be a reasonable template alternative. eScience also maintains a template called [shablona](https://github.com/uwescience/shablona).

### Recommended development practices

- The [Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/software_standards/) includes recommendations for software development practices.
- The following practices may also assist in increasing the robustness of software developed, by avoiding common pitfalls and oversights in academic research software development:
  - including [GitHub releases](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases)
  - specifying requirements (e.g., other people's software and databases) and using environment variables to locate 

### Examples

- [fredpyapplication](https://github.com/FredHutch/fredpyapplication): a collaborative, community-developed package of useful python functions being developed by the Python community at Fred Hutch.
- [phydms](https://github.com/jbloomlab/phydms): from Jesse Bloom's lab; phylogenetic analyses informed by deep mutational scanning data
- [sci-pkg](https://github.com/FredHutch/sci-pkg): from FH Scientific Computing; a collection of convenience and wrapper functions for [common science research tasks](https://pypi.org/project/sci/)
- [proxmox-tools](https://github.com/FredHutch/proxmox-tools): from FH SciComp; prox command line interface for proxmox and other tools and customizations
- [laminar](https://github.com/dgellerup/laminar): from Dane Gellerup FH Informatics Analyst Geraghty lab; High-level parallelization for easy multi-processing. Laminar seeks to take most of the effort out of parallel processing in Python by providing user-friendly parallelization functionality.
