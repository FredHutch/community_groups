# R coding group

The R coding group meets on Thursdays from noon to 1 pm in the Coop Lab (M1-B406) in the Arnold building. All Fred Hutch and SCCA employees are welcome to attend! Also please join our slack channel at `#r-user-comm` on the `fhbig.slack.com` workspace to communicate with other R users within the organization.

Please see [this issue](https://github.com/FredHutch/community_groups/issues/4) to add topics for discussion at these meetings!

The [freddie](https://github.com/FredHutch/freddie) repository is a collaborative, community-developed package of useful R functions being developed by the R community at Fred Hutch. The goal of freddie is to collect helper functions and tools that Fred Hutch R community folk create.

* [tidyr](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tidyr/versions/0.8.3) - Data Wrangling and Transformation - An evolution of 'reshape2'. It's designed specifically for data tidying (not general reshaping or aggregating) and works well with 'dplyr' data pipelines.

* [tibble](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tibble/versions/1.2) - Data Import and Management - Provides a 'tbl_df' class that offers better checking and printing capabilities than traditional data frames.
* [readr](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readr/versions/1.3.1) - Data Import and Management - The goal of 'readr' is to provide a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like 'csv', 'tsv', and 'fwf'). It is designed to flexibly parse many types of data found in the wild, while still cleanly failing when data unexpectedly changes.
* [purrr](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/purrr/versions/0.2.5) - Functional Programming - A complete and consistent functional programming toolkit for R.

* [DataExplorer](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/DataExplorer/versions/0.8.0) - Data Visualization and Exploration - Automated data exploration process for analytic tasks and predictive modeling, so that users could focus on understanding data and extracting insights. 
* [esquisse](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/esquisse/versions/0.2.2) - Data Visualization and Exploration - A 'shiny' gadget to create 'ggplot2' charts interactively with drag-and-drop to map your variables. 
* [parsnip](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/parsnip/versions/0.0.0.9001) - Machine Learning - A common interface is provided to allow users to specify a model without having to remember the different argument names across different functions or computational engines (e.g. R, spark, stan, etc).
* [Ranger](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ranger/versions/0.11.2) - Machine Learning - A Fast Implementation of Random Forests
* [Reticulate](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/reticulate/versions/1.13) - Miscellaneous Package - Interface to 'Python' modules, classes, and functions. When calling into 'Python', R data types are automatically converted to their equivalent 'Python' types.
* [InstallR](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/installr/versions/0.22.0) - Miscellaneous Package - R is great for installing software. Through the 'installr' package you can automate the updating of R (on Windows, using updateR()) and install new software.
