# R User Group

The R User Group meets weekly to discuss programming, data analysis, and troubleshooting in R. Bring your lunch, code, questions, and thoughts! R coders of all levels of expertise are welcome. Contact the Coop (coophelp at fredhutch.org) for more information. Additionally, check out the #r-user-comm channel on the [Coop Communities Slack](https://fhbig.slack.com/) and our other training and community resources at [Training, Community and Finding Help
](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/reference_training/). Note: If you do not have a laptop available to you we still want you to come!! You can email code privately ahead of each event to Amy Paguirigan (apaguiri at fredhutch.org). Current meeting schedules and locations are available on the [Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r?cid=Z2QzMGRsaWZyaTRmdTdoMTA0Y3VxZGowZGdAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).

Please see [this issue](https://github.com/FredHutch/community_groups/issues/4) to add topics for discussion at these meetings!

The [freddie](https://github.com/FredHutch/freddie) repository is a collaborative, community-developed package of useful R functions being developed by the R community at Fred Hutch. The goal of freddie is to collect helper functions and tools that Fred Hutch R community folk create.
