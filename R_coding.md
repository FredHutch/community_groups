# R coding group

The R coding group meets on Thursdays from noon to 1 pm in the Coop Lab (M1-B406). All Fred Hutch and SCCA employees are welcome to attend! 

Please see [this issue](https://github.com/FredHutch/community_groups/issues/4) to add topics for discussion at these meetings!

The [freddie](https://github.com/FredHutch/freddie) repository is a collaborative, community-developed package of useful R functions being developed by the R community at Fred Hutch.
