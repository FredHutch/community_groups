# Data visualization

- **About the data:** Data used at each week's meeting is available through the 
[TidyTuesday GitHub repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). 
From the main repository, navigate to the `data` directory, then the folder 
corresponding to the date for that week. The file called `readme.md` in that folder 
describes the data, including where they came from, how it's organized, and what the 
columns and rows represent. 
- **Obtaining the data:** From the GitHub repository linked above, you can click on 
the `*.csv` file for the week's data, then click the `Download` button. If you 
are working in R, we recommend Ellis Hughes' 
[tidytuesdayR package](https://github.com/thebioengineer/tidytuesdayR).
- **Creating visualizations:** You are welcome to use whatever method you prefer 
to create visualizations! Folks who regularly attend our group tend to use the following: 
  - *R:* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) and associated packages
