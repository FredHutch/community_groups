# Software Development group

The Software Development group meets on the second Monday of the month from noon to 1 pm in the Coop Lab (M1-B406). All Fred Hutch and SCCA employees are welcome to attend!

## Collaboration in GitHub

- [**Git Hooks**](https://githooks.com): scripts that Git executes before or after an event like `commit` or `push`
- [**Collaborative development models**](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-collaborative-development-models): how pull requests are managed in a collaborative project
  - The [Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org) uses the shared repository model
- A nice series of [Advanced Tutorials in GitHub](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/advanced-overview), some of the most useful include:
  - [**rebase**](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing): an alternative to merging branches; base your changes on what have already been done
  - [**cherry picking**](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/cherry-pick): picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another
- [**squash and rebase workflow**](https://blog.carbonfive.com/2017/08/28/always-squash-and-rebase-your-git-commits/): clean up your git log, and guarantee all commits in master build and pass tests
- [**manubot**](https://manubot.org): tools for publishing, tracked in git
