# Software Development group

The Software Development group meets on the second Monday of the month from noon to 1 pm in the Coop Lab (M1-B406). All Fred Hutch and SCCA employees are welcome to attend!

This group is focused on technical aspects of software development and design, ranging from UI/UX (user experience testing) to interactions between different types of software and languages. Researchers, developers, and analysts (and anyone else interested!) working in all coding languages are welcome. The resources below are notes and useful links from our meetings. Types of activites at these meetings include:
- group discussions about topics of interest, sometimes with invited speakers 
- walking through a software stack for a given project
- technically-focused lightning talks

To recommend topics or activites, please use [this issue](https://github.com/FredHutch/community_groups/issues/3).

## Collaboration in GitHub

- [**Git Hooks**](https://githooks.com): scripts that Git executes before or after an event like `commit` or `push`
- [**Collaborative development models**](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-collaborative-development-models): how pull requests are managed in a collaborative project
  - The [Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org) uses the shared repository model
- A nice series of [Advanced Tutorials in GitHub](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/advanced-overview), some of the most useful include:
  - [**rebase**](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing): an alternative to merging branches; base your changes on what have already been done
  - [**cherry picking**](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/cherry-pick): picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another
- [**squash and rebase workflow**](https://blog.carbonfive.com/2017/08/28/always-squash-and-rebase-your-git-commits/): clean up your git log, and guarantee all commits in master build and pass tests
- [**manubot**](https://manubot.org): tools for publishing, tracked in git
