# Data visualization

The Data Viz lunch group currently meets weekly on Wednesdays in 
The Coop Lab, M1-B406 (Arnold). Everyone in the Fred Hutch staff and
research community is welcome to attend!

## How the meetings work

The [TidyTuesday](https://thomasmock.netlify.com/post/tidytuesday-a-weekly-social-data-project-in-r/) 
project releases a curated, publicly available dataset every week 
and encourages the data science community to use it to develop new 
data visualizations. While this project was started in the 
R4DS ([R for Data Science](https://www.jessemaegan.com/post/r4ds-the-next-iteration/)) 
community, it is a great opportunity for anyone interested in data viz! 

If you're new to data viz, interested in learning more, or would like to hang 
out and talk code for an hour over lunch, please feel free to join us! 
You don't need to prepare anything ahead of time, though we recommend 
bringing a laptop if you'd like to work on a visualization of your own. 

We usually spend the first 10-15 minutes talking about the data for the week 
and brainstorming ideas for types of visualizations that might be interesting. 
Then we spend 30-45 minutes working on our own or in small groups to develop 
visualizations. At the end of the hour (or whenever we get excited about a result), 
we share our visualizations with each other. 

If you are especially proud of a visualization you create, we encourage you to share it 
on Twitter (using the hashtag [#TidyTuesday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TidyTuesday&src=typd))
or post to the #data-viz channel on the [Fred Hutch Coop Communities Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/fhbig/shared_invite/enQtMzUyMDIxNzk3MDU3LWNjMDg3ZDVhNGZiNTBlODRmNWM5ZjczMzI1MGNmZTg4NGQ5ODgzMGNmMjcyNzMxMDc0YWFlN2VkNjI4NGZjNjg).

## About the data

Data used at each week's meeting is available through the 
[TidyTuesday GitHub repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). 
From the main repository, navigate to the `data` directory, then the folder 
corresponding to the date for that week. The file called `readme.md` in that folder 
describes the data, including where they came from, how it's organized, and what the 
columns and rows represent. 

## Obtaining the data

From the GitHub repository linked above, you can click on 
the `*.csv` file for the week's data, then click the `Download` button. If you 
are working in R, we recommend Ellis Hughes' 
[tidytuesdayR package](https://github.com/thebioengineer/tidytuesdayR).

## Creating visualizations

You are welcome to use whatever method you prefer 
to create visualizations! Folks who regularly attend our group tend to use the following: 

### R

* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) and associated packages
* [plotly](https://plot.ly/r/)
  
### Python

* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)
* [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/)
* [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/)

### Tableau

We have an active [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com) user community at Fred Hutch;
please check out their channel on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/fhbig/shared_invite/enQtMzUyMDIxNzk3MDU3LWNjMDg3ZDVhNGZiNTBlODRmNWM5ZjczMzI1MGNmZTg4NGQ5ODgzMGNmMjcyNzMxMDc0YWFlN2VkNjI4NGZjNjg).

### Web-based tools

If you'd like to work on data visualization but would like to 
use a web-based, point-and-click interface for exploratory data 
analysis, we recommend you check out [RAWGraphs](https://rawgraphs.io).
Click on `Use it now!` to upload a data set (or use one of the examples provided),
then scroll down the page to choose a chart type and select how data are displayed.
