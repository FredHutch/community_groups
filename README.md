# Fred Hutch Data Science Community Groups

This repository holds descriptions and resources associated with collaborative, community-focused data science groups at Fred Hutch sponsored by the Fred Hutch Bioinformatics and Data Science Cooperative (The Coop).

For more information on groups and other events hosted by the Coop, please see our [webpage](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en/community/hosted-groups.html) and the [training page](https://github.com/fredhutch/community_groups) on the Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki.

Current groups include:

- [Data Visualization](#data-visualization)
- [Python Coding](#python-coding)
- [R Coding](#r-coding)
- [Shiny Applications](#shiny-applications)
- [Software Development](#software-development)

If you have an idea for a new group, please look at our [guidelines](#want-to-create-a-new-community-group).

## [Data visualization](data_viz.md)

Weekly meeting to discuss data visualization and create visualizations from the dataset released each week by [R for Data Science](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

## [Python Coding](python.md)

Weekly meeting to discuss and troubleshoot Python code.

## [R Coding](R.md)

Weekly meeting to discuss and troubleshoot R code.

## [Shiny Applications](shiny.md)

Monthly meeting to discuss and troubleshoot Shiny applications.

## [Software Development](software_dev.md)

Monthly meeting to discuss software design and development.

## Want to create a new community group?

The Coop is happy to support formation of new community groups related to data science activities. We ask that you answer a few questions to guide your planning process:

- What are the goals of your group?
- Who is interested in participating
- Who will lead/facilitate the group?
- How often do you want to meet? Some groups meet weekly, every other week, or on the first/second/etc day of the month.

It may help to look at some of the information about existing groups to help get an idea of what has been working for our community so far. You can also post in the Coop Community Slack to gauge interest in the community. Once you are committed to the meeting details, contact one of the [Coop team members](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en/contact.html) with the following information:

- Title (e.g., "Python coding group")
- Description (e.g., "Any Python users (beginner to advanced) are welcome to attend this session and to talk about programming and data analysis in Python. Bring your lunch, your code questions, and your thoughts! Contact *this person* for more information.")
- Open or closed? We prefer community groups to be open to everyone. If you request a group to be closed, we'll add "[closed]" to the title.
- Who is the point of contact? We'll need someone to help answer questions about scheduling, etc.
- Time and date of the first meeting, and the continued schedule (so we can put a repeat on calendars)

We'll use this information to:

- post to the Google and Outlook calendars (we usually don't add community groups to CenterNet)
- announce in our [monthly newsletter](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en/newsletter.html) and on Slack
- list on our [webpage](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en/community/hosted-groups.html) and the [training page](https://github.com/fredhutch/community_groups) on the Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki.
