# Shiny Application Group

[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) is an R package that can create interactive web applications for visualizing data analysis. This group meets once a month to discuss the following:

1) Building and troubleshooting Shiny apps
2) Web development and design for non-web developers 
3) Resources and information sharing: Will a shiny app do what I am envisioning? Can I see more example apps? What resources are available at the Hutch to deploy and share the app (with the right people)?
